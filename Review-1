## 🔍 **Introduction**  
The automotive industry **relies on efficient supply chain management** to ensure timely production, cost minimization, and demand fulfillment. However, traditional supply chain systems face challenges like **delayed parts supply, inefficient inventory tracking, and poor demand forecasting**.  

This project proposes an **AI-powered Automotive Supply Chain System** that integrates **machine learning, predictive analytics, and IoT** to address these inefficiencies.  

---

## ❌ **Challenges in the Existing System**  
- **Unpredictable Demand Fluctuations** – Difficulty in forecasting demand leads to supply chain disruptions.  
- **Complex Supplier Networks** – Lack of real-time coordination results in delays.  
- **High Inventory Costs** – Overstocking increases expenses, while shortages delay manufacturing.  
- **Transportation Delays** – Inefficient logistics management impacts vehicle production schedules.  
- **Limited Real-time Data Usage** – Many companies lack **AI-powered analytics** to optimize performance.

## ✅ **Proposed AI-Powered Solution**  
To solve these issues, the **AI-driven Automotive Supply Chain System** includes:  

🔹 **AI-Driven Demand Forecasting** – ML models predict vehicle and spare part demand based on historical trends.  
🔹 **Smart Inventory Management** – AI optimizes stock levels, preventing over/understocking.  
🔹 **Supplier Coordination Automation** – AI streamlines communication with suppliers to reduce delays.  
🔹 **Optimized Logistics Planning** – AI-based route optimization ensures faster, cost-effective delivery.  
🔹 **Real-time Supply Chain Analytics** – Dashboards provide insights into inventory, supplier performance, and logistics tracking.  
🔹 **Cost-Effective Procurement Strategies** – AI-driven contract negotiation reduces procurement costs.
